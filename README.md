- Randomly select one background image each time you run the program

- Provide five kinds of enemy planes

- My plane will lose hit points(`HP`) when it has a collision with the enemy plane

- When my plane hit the enemy plane with the bullets, my plane will win certain scores according the different kind of enemy plane

- The enemy plane will lose their hit points(`HP`) each time they have a collision with the bullet from my plane, and they will explode when their `HP = 0`
